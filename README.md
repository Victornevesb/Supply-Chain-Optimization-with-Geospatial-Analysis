# Supply-Chain-Optimization-with-Geospatial-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize supply chain logistics through geospatial analysis, focusing on route optimization and logistics management. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and data analysis, this project maps optimal routes and evaluates geographical factors such as traffic, distance, and regional shipping regulations. This approach provides actionable insights into improving route efficiency, lowering operational costs, and increasing supply chain resilience.

## Key Features
**Route Optimization**: Identify the most efficient routes based on distance, traffic data, and regulatory restrictions.

**Geospatial Analysis**: Use geospatial data to analyze geographical constraints and factors affecting logistics.

**Traffic and Congestion Insights**: Integrate traffic data to identify congestion points and high-traffic zones for better planning.
  
**Visualization**: Map and visualize routes, distribution center locations, and traffic hot spots using GIS tools.

##Technology Stack
**Python Libraries**:
- `GeoPandas`: Geospatial data handling.
- `NetworkX`: Graph-based route optimization.
- `Folium` or `OSMNX`: Interactive mapping and OpenStreetMap data handling.
**Database**: `SQLite` with SpatiaLite extension for geospatial data support.
**GIS Tools**:
- DB Browser for `SQLite` for database management.
- `QGIS` or `ArcGIS` for advanced mapping and data visualization.
  
**Data Sources**
This project utilizes open-source geospatial and traffic data. Data sources include:

**Road Networks**: OpenStreetMap data, loaded via `OSMNX` for Python.
**Traffic Data**: Government open-data portals or APIs like Google Maps API or Here Maps API.
**Weather Data**: NOAA or OpenWeather APIs for incorporating environmental factors.
**Shipping Regulations**: Local government GIS or open-data portals for road restrictions.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Install Python from python.org.

SQLite with SpatiaLite Extension: Install SpatiaLite to add geospatial capabilities to SQLite.

Python Libraries: Install required Python packages using requirements.txt.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 1: Database Setup
Create the SQLite Database:

Open DB Browser for SQLite and create a new database named supply_chain_optimization.db in the db folder.
Load the SpatiaLite extension (usually available under the Extensions menu in DB Browser for SQLite).
Run the SQL commands in db_setup.sql (in the scripts folder) to create the necessary tables for road networks, traffic data, distribution centers, and regulations.
Data Ingestion:

Place your raw data files in the data/ folder.
Run the scripts/ingest_data.py script to load data into the SQLite database.
bash
Copy code
python scripts/ingest_data.py
Step 2: Route Optimization and Geospatial Analysis
Run the scripts/optimize_routes.py script to perform route optimization. This script calculates optimal routes between distribution centers and key locations, considering factors like traffic and distance.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/optimize_routes.py
Step 3: Visualization
Use QGIS or ArcGIS to load and visualize the data from the SQLite database (db/supply_chain_optimization.db). You can map optimized routes, traffic congestion zones, and distribution center locations for better analysis.

Alternatively, visualize the routes interactively in a Jupyter notebook by running the notebooks/analysis.ipynb notebook.

Example Queries
Retrieve Roads in a Specific Area:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM road_network
WHERE ST_Within(geometry, (SELECT geometry FROM regions WHERE name = 'RegionName'));
Identify Congested Routes:

sql
Copy code
SELECT rn.name, td.congestion_level
FROM road_network rn
JOIN traffic_data td ON rn.road_id = td.road_id
WHERE td.congestion_level = 'high'
ORDER BY td.timestamp DESC;
Future Improvements
Enhanced Traffic Prediction: Integrate machine learning models to predict future traffic based on historical data.
Real-Time Data Integration: Incorporate APIs for live traffic and weather data for real-time route adjustments.
Cost Analysis: Add cost metrics (e.g., fuel, tolls) to further optimize route selection.
